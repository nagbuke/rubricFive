			<h3><br>Pitter-Patter</h3><br>
				<p>Blood-stained booties like 
					
				<br>Dorothy in her prime

				<br>Battle cries of the precarious beat goes

				<br>Pitter-patter, pitter-patter

						<br>

				<br>The falling of the heel - like thunder

				<br>Pitter-patter, pitter-patter

				<br>Strutting as on tempests' wings

				<br>Pitter-patter, pitter-patter

						<br>

				<br>Pitter-patter goes the soles like violent

				<br>Sails upon the beach

				<br>Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-

				<br>Patter, pitter-</p>

			<h3><br>Grand Ole House</h3><br>
			<p>

					The dwarves built that house – it seemed 
				<br>With their ruddy hands and rugged mallets they tinkered 
				<br>Transforming mountainous boulder to strident brick 
				<br>For whom have they built such a grand ole house? <br>
				<br>That rushing waterfall torn from its seams 
				<br>They thrusted it onto that rosy shire’s hearth 
				<br>The scent of fresh water – so supple and crisp 
				<br>For whom have they built such a grand ole house?<br> 
				<br>With opals and ambers the doors and windows were lade 
				<br>From every drop of sunshine the colors would burst flashing 
				<br>purples and yellows iridescently lit 
				<br>For whom have they built such a grand ole house!</p>
